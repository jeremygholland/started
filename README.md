# InMotion Coding Challenge for Jeremy Holland
<br>
<br>
Please note. To be able to run this program you will need to have gulp installed on your machine. You can learn more about gulp at <a href ="http://gulpjs.com/"> gulp's website</a>. 
</br>
<br>
To start program, clone this repo and then run:
<br>
<br>
 ` cd started`<br>
` npm install`<br>
  `gulp
  `
  <br>
  <br>
This project used Zellwk's gulp starter to begin this project and it keeps its file structure. It as well uses Angular's Ui-Router.

Thank you for your time.
